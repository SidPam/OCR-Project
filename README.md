# OCR Project
 Optical Character Recognition of capital letters along with models to perform sentiment analysis based on Naive Bayes\
 This project was initially done as a task for joining Epoch- The AI/ML and Data Science club of IIT Hyderabad\
 Hence several nods to the resources provided such as the Jurafsky NLP book and neuralnine video on OCR are mentioned in the work description.\
 The model was also made using tensorflow as I was struggling to set up pyTorch on my then Windows laptop. I have left those points in the work description as I feel it important to be faithful to my original work.
